# Domain 2: Security Architecture

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Secure network design: DMZ, segmentation, zoning
- System architecture: host security, trusted computing base
- Virtualization: hypervisors, VM escape risks
- Cloud security: shared responsibility model

## 🔐 Security Controls
| Control Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Preventive   | Firewalls, access controls |
| Detective    | IDS/IPS, audit logs |
| Corrective   | Patch management, backups |
